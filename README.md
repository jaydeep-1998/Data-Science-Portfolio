# Machine Learning Portfolio cum Learning

This is a collection of the projects I've worked on or am working on right now.
____

#### Numpy
- Learned numpy array creation, aggreation function like min,max,sum,argmin,argmax etc. Furthermore, explored slicing and dicing of numpy array. Performed arithmatic operations on numpy array.

____

#### Pandas
- learned how to select data using conditions,selecting data using loc and iloc methods. Additionally explored grouped by method which plays significant role while analysing data. Found how to spot duplicated and missing data as well as how to handle them. Moreover examined several methods, including value counts, unique, crosstab, apply, and many more. Learned how to combine, connect, and concatenate series objects with pandas dataframes.
____
